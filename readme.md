hi

This is a hard migration of the additional material of the paper Constructing Visual Representations: Investigating the Use of Tangible Tokens by Huron, Samuel and Jansen, Yvonne and Carpendale, Sheelagh which was initially hosted on http://constructive.gforge.inria.fr/. 

For some reason some of the javascript is not working (I do not have the time to fix it now). 
You can access the content throught this links:
